Dialogware is a unique platform that enables companies to quickly create and deploy their own Proof of Concept (PoC) in hours, minutes or even seconds. It provides an intuitive interface for non-technical users to easily define their PoC using text-based instructions, which are then converted into software. The resulting PoC can then be tested and used by customers to evaluate the product or service.

Dialogware also allows companies to customize their PoC solutions to match the customer's needs. This makes it an ideal platform for quickly testing out new features, launching products into new markets, and providing customers with a unique and personalized experience. With Dialogware, companies can create and deliver a high-quality PoC quickly and cost-effectively.


## Use Case 

As a freelancer and developer I declined one thing: Doing free PoCs and free work! 


## Why?

When you try to reach bigger enterprises and customers to generate some work, 
sometimes, someone will propose that you do free PoC or some form of consulting to prove your offer's value. 

Maybe because I didn't know about the concept of "free work" or not making a profit, I've always rejected those proposals. 

Why? 

You bring time and knowledge to the table in the professional services business. 
Both have value. 

### Not so perfect way

The mistake you can make as a solo/bootstrapped business is to assume that you have to do "free" work to get into a market. 

You don't. 

Just be prepared to have this discussion:
+ Have a value/price proposition for PoC with a clear outcome that which customer can use afterward 
+ Have a ready proposal for the workshop to gather information, which customers can use even if they will go with someone else. 

Bring value with transparent pricing, and you will be surprised how many customers will go for it. 

+ Your success rate might be lower but better aligned with those committed. 
+ Your time and cash flow are your most significant assets, especially at the early stage. 
+ Allocate both wisely. 

### The Correct way

There is another way, where You can create a hashtag #SaaS  for a hashtag #PoC  :)

We choose another way, where the customer can define and deploy the PoC from ideas at very low costs and rapidly in hours, minutes and after years of dialogware development it will take a seconds.

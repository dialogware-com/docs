## How it work's?

After you have answered our questions with a few sentences about your expectations, 
you will implement your first MVP version of a web/mobile application yourself and within minutes rather than weeks.


## Benefits?

This is a much cheaper and easier way than no-code or low-code solutions, you can save much more time and money than today.
We "twitterize" the software development and will build any software just with the (con)text of description, specification, documentation...

Our goal is building software in minutes with humanless software development systems.

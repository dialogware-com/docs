build the software in minutes with [DIALOGWARE](http://www.dialogware.com/) 

Imagine, write and deploy your application.
We provide a platform [#text2software](https://www.text2software.com/)
to prepare your first MVP application in a minutes.
After you answer on our questions with few sentences of your expectation, we will deploy your first MVP version of web/mobile application.
It's much cheaper and easy way than no-code or low-code solutions.

With such automatization, you can save more time and money than with another solutions such #lowcode or #nocode.
We "twitterize" the software development and will build any software just with the (con)text (specification, documentation).

Please find more details in [Documentation](http://docs.dialogware.com/)

We are on [Pioneer](https://pioneer.app/join/dialogware.com)

## We start soon...

Dialogflow

Dialogflow is a natural language understanding platform that makes it easy to design and integrate a conversational user interface into your mobile app, web application, device, bot, interactive voice response system, and so on. Using Dialogflow, you can provide new and engaging ways for users to interact with your product.

Dialogflow can analyze multiple types of input from your customers, including text or audio inputs (like from a phone or voice recording). It can also respond to your customers in a couple of ways, either through text or with synthetic speech.


Dialog Stream:
A dialog stream is a sequential flow of conversational interactions between a user and a conversational agent. It represents the interaction as a series of turns or exchanges of messages, where each turn consists of a user message followed by an agent response. The dialog stream can be represented as a list or an array of these turns.

Dialog Graph:
A dialog graph, on the other hand, represents the conversation as a directed graph, where each node represents a state or a point in the conversation, and each edge represents a possible transition or action. The nodes can be thought of as different states of the dialog, such as gathering user information, performing a task, or providing recommendations. The edges represent the possible actions that can be taken, such as user inputs or agent responses.

In essence, a dialog stream captures the chronological order of the conversation, while a dialog graph captures the structure and possible paths of the conversation. Dialog graphs are often used to model more complex conversational flows and enable more advanced functionality such as multi-turn dialog management, context tracking, and decision-making.

Both dialog streams and dialog graphs are useful representations for analyzing, designing, and implementing conversational systems. The choice between the two depends on the specific use case and the level of complexity required for representing the conversation
